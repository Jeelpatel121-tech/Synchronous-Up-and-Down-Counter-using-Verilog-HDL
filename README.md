# Synchronous-Up-and-Down-Counter-using-Verilog-HDL
A Synchronous Up and Down Counter is a sequential digital circuit that increments or decrements its count value on every active clock edge, based on a control signal. In this project, the counter updates its output synchronously with the clock, ensuring predictable and stable operation.
